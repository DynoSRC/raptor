# raptor
A JSX layout engine.

Raptor is intended for use with the boring framework, but can be used by itself.

## Usage

TL;DR: Configure raptor with knowledge of your views and view model hierchy.
Then give it a JSON blob of view models and it will stitch together the
appropriate JSX for you.

### 1. Tell raptor about your views.

### 2. Tell raptor about your view model hieracy for each page (i.e. route).

### 3. Tell raptor to render a given page with a given (hydrated) view model.
